Project assignment for LINFO1104!

Uses n-grams to predict the next word in a sequence of words.

## Building

Assuming [Mozart 2](https://github.com/mozart/mozart2) is installed, simply run:

```console
make
```

(This uses GNU Make; use `gmake` on other Unices.)

## Running

Still with GNU Make:

```console
make run
```

## Screenshots

TODO ;)
